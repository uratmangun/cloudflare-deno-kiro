# Tailwind CSS v4 and shadcn/ui Migration Requirements

## Introduction
This specification covers the migration of a React + Vite project from Tailwind CSS v3 configuration to Tailwind CSS v4 with proper shadcn/ui integration. The project requires a complete overhaul of the CSS build pipeline, import syntax, and theme configuration to ensure all styles load and render correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Tailwind CSS v4 Integration
**User Story:** As a developer, I want Tailwind CSS v4 to be properly integrated with Vite, so that all utility classes and styles are generated and applied correctly in the React application.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the development server starts THEN the system SHALL use the @tailwindcss/vite plugin instead of PostCSS
2. WHEN CSS files are processed THEN the system SHALL recognize @import "tailwindcss" syntax instead of @tailwind directives
3. WHEN Tailwind classes are used in components THEN the system SHALL generate and apply the corresponding CSS styles

### Requirement 2: shadcn/ui Component Styling
**User Story:** As a developer, I want shadcn/ui components to render with proper styling, so that the UI appears as intended with correct colors, spacing, and visual hierarchy.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN shadcn/ui components are rendered THEN the system SHALL apply CSS custom properties correctly
2. WHEN theme variables are referenced THEN the system SHALL resolve hsl() wrapped color values
3. WHEN components use design tokens THEN the system SHALL map theme variables through @theme inline directive

### Requirement 3: CSS Build Pipeline Optimization
**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CSS build process to be optimized for Tailwind v4, so that build times are faster and the development experience is improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the project builds THEN the system SHALL use the Vite plugin instead of PostCSS for better performance
2. WHEN CSS changes are made THEN the system SHALL provide fast incremental rebuilds
3. WHEN the development server runs THEN the system SHALL not require PostCSS configuration files

### Requirement 4: Theme Configuration Compatibility
**User Story:** As a developer, I want the theme configuration to be compatible with both Tailwind v4 and shadcn/ui, so that color schemes and design tokens work seamlessly together.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN CSS variables are defined THEN the system SHALL wrap color values in hsl() functions
2. WHEN theme variables are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide proper mapping through @theme inline
3. WHEN dark mode is toggled THEN the system SHALL apply the correct color scheme variables

### Requirement 5: Development Environment Stability
**User Story:** As a developer, I want the development environment to be stable and error-free, so that I can focus on building features without CSS-related interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the development server starts THEN the system SHALL not display CSS-related errors
2. WHEN files are saved THEN the system SHALL hot-reload styles without requiring manual cache clearing
3. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL have all required packages for Tailwind v4 and shadcn/ui
