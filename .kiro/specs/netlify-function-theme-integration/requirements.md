# Netlify Function Theme Integration Requirements

## Introduction
This specification covers the implementation of Netlify serverless function integration and comprehensive dark theme support for the React + shadcn/ui + Netlify boilerplate application. The project transforms a static interactive counter into a dynamic API-driven interface while providing seamless theme switching capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Netlify Function API Integration
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace the static interactive counter with a button that calls a Netlify serverless function, so that I can demonstrate API integration capabilities in the boilerplate.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the user clicks the "Call Netlify Function" button THEN the system SHALL make an HTTP request to `/.netlify/functions/hello`
2. WHEN the API call is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a loading state with "Calling API..." text
3. WHEN the API call succeeds THEN the system SHALL display the response data including message, timestamp, random number, and status
4. WHEN the API call fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with appropriate styling
5. WHEN the Netlify function is invoked THEN it SHALL return a JSON response with greeting, timestamp, random number, and success status

### Requirement 2: ES Module Compliance
**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Netlify function to use ES module syntax, so that it follows modern JavaScript standards and eliminates CommonJS warnings.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the Netlify function is defined THEN it SHALL use `export const handler` syntax instead of `exports.handler`
2. WHEN the development server runs THEN there SHALL be no CommonJS module warnings
3. WHEN the function is deployed THEN it SHALL maintain compatibility with Netlify's serverless environment

### Requirement 3: Dark Theme Switcher
**User Story:** As a user, I want to toggle between light, dark, and system theme modes, so that I can customize the interface appearance according to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the user clicks the theme toggle button THEN the system SHALL cycle through light → dark → system → light modes
2. WHEN in light mode THEN the system SHALL display a sun icon and apply light color scheme
3. WHEN in dark mode THEN the system SHALL display a moon icon and apply dark color scheme
4. WHEN in system mode THEN the system SHALL respect the user's OS color scheme preference
5. WHEN the theme changes THEN the system SHALL persist the preference in localStorage
6. WHEN the page reloads THEN the system SHALL restore the previously selected theme

### Requirement 4: Theme Visual Consistency
**User Story:** As a user, I want all interface elements to properly adapt to the selected theme, so that I have a consistent visual experience across the entire application.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN dark mode is active THEN all backgrounds SHALL use appropriate dark colors (slate-900/800)
2. WHEN dark mode is active THEN all text SHALL use light colors for proper contrast
3. WHEN light mode is active THEN all backgrounds SHALL use light colors (slate-50/100)
4. WHEN light mode is active THEN all text SHALL use dark colors for readability
5. WHEN hovering over the theme toggle THEN the icon SHALL display with proper contrast (black in light mode, white in dark mode)
6. WHEN using shadcn/ui components THEN they SHALL automatically adapt using CSS variables

### Requirement 5: Accessibility and UX
**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the theme switcher and API interface to be fully accessible, so that I can use all features regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN using screen readers THEN the theme toggle SHALL provide appropriate aria labels
2. WHEN the theme toggle is focused THEN it SHALL display visible focus indicators
3. WHEN API operations occur THEN loading states SHALL be announced to screen readers
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be clearly communicated with appropriate color coding and text
5. WHEN the theme toggle is positioned THEN it SHALL not interfere with other interface elements
